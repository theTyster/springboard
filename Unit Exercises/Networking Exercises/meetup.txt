I did a meetup through LunchClub and was able to meet a man who worked in
insurance sales. He explained to me a bit about what he does and who he works
for. I asked him a bit about how he made contacts and where they got leads from.
Apparently most of them come through Data Brokers. Which I thought was pretty
interesting. We talked about that for a little bit.  

He asked me about Springboard and my interest in becoming a WebDeveloper. I
didn't add him on Linkedin or any other sites. I don't think we would be able to
help each other too much. But, nonetheless, it was fun to be able to talk to
someone new.
