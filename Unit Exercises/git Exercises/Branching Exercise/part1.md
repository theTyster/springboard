# Part 1

1. What git command creates a branch?
`git checkout -b {branchname}`

3. What git command changes to another branch?
`git switch {branchname}`
4. What git command deletes a branch?
`git branch -d {branchname}`

Merge conflicts happen if there are edits on both local and remote branches to the same files.
