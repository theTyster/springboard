1. The main difference is hoisting. `var` hoists the declared variables to the top of the document or block depending on scope. `var` also allows variables to be redeclared and reassigned. `let` only allows variables to be reassigned.
2. `const` does not allow redeclaring or reassigning of variables and also does not hoist.
3. The main difference between `let` and `const` is reassigned. `let` allows variables to be reassigned.
4. Hoisting happens when are "moved" in a way to the top of the scope they are declared in. Variables that are hoisted can be accessed before they are declared. This can lead to lots of bugs.
